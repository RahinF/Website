<h1><center>About Me</center></h1>
<p class = "ex1">

My name is Rahin. I'm currently studying Bachelor of Information Technology at RMIT through Open Universities Australia. When I finished high school I had the intention of becoming a graphic designer since I had a passion for creating digital art. The subjects I studied were all related to art and digital media, I even did a certificate 3 in Media with RMIT. I soon learned how competitive the field was and decided to move to something that would allow me to get a stable job. I chose to study a degree in Human Resource Management. I always had the mindset that I'm not going to enjoy working so it doesn't matter where I work. This field did not suit me one bit, as someone who dislikes conflict, trying to interact with people without making them upset made me anxious. I decided HR wasn't for me. I needed an outlet for my ideas and thoughts, I wanted to be creative so i decided to study IT in order to learn programming something in which I always had an interest in but never pursued.
<br><br>
I chose to study at RMIT through Open Universities Australia mainly because it was convenient. I work full time and I can’t afford to lose my job to study at a campus, the travel times and inconvenient class times are something I don't want to deal with again. OUA allows me to study at home without needing to move around wasting valuable time making it much easier to plan out my week.
<br><br>
What I expect to learn during my studies is how to code in several languages. I’m interesting in learning about the history of IT and how it’s evolving. What also interests me is the current and future trends and how I can use this knowledge to my advantage to secure a job and adapt whenever there is a change.
<br><br>
After graduation I hope to find a job in the IT industry as soon as possible and utilize my newly developed programming skills and knowledge.
<br><br>
As for hobbies I enjoy playing video games, watching anime, reading manga and playing collectible card games such as YuGiOh and Magic the Gathering to name a few.

<h1><center>Interest in IT</center></h1><br>
<p class = "ex1">

My interest in IT started when I started high school, I’ve always liked playing video games since I was a kid and I’ve always wanted to make my own. My own story, characters and finishing moves. I searched the web to find a program that would allow me to create my game and I discovered RPG Maker VX Ace. It was neat program, I could enter my characters, classes, stats, weapons and armors into the database, create maps and click run and play the game of my dreams. It was cool and all but it was very simple, the program itself was basic. The program uses ‘Ruby’ and it gave the user ability to add scripts, this opened up so many options [1]. The community was fairly large so there were hundreds of scripts. I found that there were things that I liked and some that I didn't. 
<br><br>
I wanted something that was more specific so I decided to learn how to code and failed miserably. I kept on going even though I still don't know much I find it very enjoyable. I’ve been told before that people who can draw can’t code and vice versa, this really motivated me, if I can do both I create something really amazing.
<br><br>
In the past I created parts of website for a party supply business that a friends mother was running. I used my skills in Photoshop to create pictures and my limited HTML and CSS knowledge to make it into a menu. It wasn't anything too spectacular but I got some good feedback.

<h1><center>Ideal Job</center></h1>


<center><img src="images/JobAD.png" alt="Job ad"></center><br><br>
<p class = "ex1">
This job is for people who recently completed an IT degree and is looking for an opportunity to work in the IT industry. It offers mentoring and career progression. I find this job advertisement appealing because of it's achievability. It gets me into the industry and allows me to learn and improve my skills by being taught by experienced professionals. Career progression is also an important aspect in its appeal as it gives me motivation to get better and exceed my limits. 
<br><br>
The job requires the candidate to be a recent graduate whose focus is on development. The programming languages that the candidate must know are: C#, ASP.net, JavaScript/Node JS, HTML/CSS and MSSQL. Presenting yourself well and good personal skills are also necessary. The candidate must be able to work well in a team based environment and have motivation and enthusiasm towards learning.
<br><br>
At the moment I do not possess many skills that are required in order to be a successful candidate. I know a little bit in JavaScript, HTML and CSS. I believe I have a good attitude towards learning and can present myself well in addition to being able to work in team based environments.
<br><br>
By the time I graduate I'm hoping to acquire the required skills in programming whether it be by studying with RMIT or in my own free time. I want to acquire a wide range of skills that are useful to any organisation. I will have to polish up my communication skills, this can be done by constantly interacting with different people and pushing myself out of my comfort zone. I'm always trying to improve myself,
I feel as long as I'm motivated my attitude and skills will get better.

<p class = "ex1">



<br><br>
According to the results from the tests I am an introvert, which is true as I like to keep to myself and rarely open up to others. I’m the quiet type, I don’t really say much but when I do I want my contributions to be meaningful. Because of that I’m good at listening to others and I’m willing to change my views when more information is presented to me. I'm open to ideas and think carefully about the pro and cons of each one. I’m a visual learner, I have a easier time understanding things when they are shown to me rather than spoken. As perfectionist I try to stay neat and organised, I do things to the best of my ability and try to go even further which often leads to a lot of time and energy being wasted doing something I didn't need to. As a defender my strategy to everyday situations and to achieve goals is constant improvement, I shouldn’t try to ‘wing it’. I'm fairly moody, it's easy for me to get upset and because of this I don't always think things through.
<br><br>
I believe these results will influence my behavior in a team in a couple ways. I'll be throwing out ideas and try to expand on existing ones suggested by others. I don't try to steer the team to certain goal but rather guide them by going into extensive detail on the pros and cons making it clear which routes not to take. I take on more work than I should and try to pick up slack to make up for my lack of interaction.
<br><br>
When forming a team I need to take into considerations what role each team member plays in the group. I'm not a leader type, I don’t have the confidence and need constant reassurance that I am doing the right thing and going in the right direction. I need to understand that people are different, they have different ways of thinking and expressing themselves. I want to avoid starting conflict by nitpicking on small issues. I'm not as adventurous as others, i'm very realistic, this leads to my ideas being very bland.

<h1><center>Project Ideas</center></h1><br>
<p class = "ex1">

One of the ideas for a project of mine is to create a digital collectible card game (CCG). I've always been a fan of trading card games. What I enjoyed was building a collection of my favourite cards, building a ‘deck’ to compete with friends and the strategy and mechanics of the game. I haven't really fleshed out any of the mechanics for my game idea but the base for most CCGs are similar. There are aspects that are similar all CCGs have such as deck building, lobbies and the battlefield.
<br><br>
In the deck building area, decks are created. Many restrictions exist such as the number of copies of a card, number of cards in a deck and limited/forbidden cards which you can only have a certain number of or not allowed to use at all. While all CCGs are different there are always card limits, this means you can only have for example up to 3 copies of that 1 card. Take Magic: the Gathering for example which has many formats all with different rules. Decks in the ‘Standard’ format must have at least 60 cards and can have up to 4 copies a card [2]. While in the ‘Commander’ format you must have exactly 100 cards, one must be a legendary creature that is designated as your commander (basically what represents the player), all cards in the deck must be of the same color identity as your commander and you can only have 1 copy of each card unless its for basic lands (a resource used to make the game progress) [3]. 
<br><br>
As a game continues to grow, more and more cards are added and in order to balance the game powerful cards need to be limited in its uses. This is done by reducing the number of copies a deck can have or not allowing the player to use it at all. To create the deck building area a couple things are needed such as an area to display what is in the deck currently, a section that displays the card details and a search/filter area to help the user find what they are looking for. In order for the search and filter system to work, the cards themselves must have some way to be searched this can be done by assigning attributes such as stats, element, name, type, limit status or effect. 
<br><br>
The lobby area is kind of like a room, players can start battles and chat with one another. The battle can be set to have certain restrictions in place such as a time limit, number rounds and different life points. A server is needed to allow players to connect together online, multiple servers may be needed if there is a large amount of traffic. Servers are a constant upkeep as they cost money to keep them running.
<br><br>
The battlefield is where the battle takes place, the goal is usually to reduce your opponent life total to 0. At the start of the game a method of selecting who goes first is needed, this can be done with giving the players an option to choose heads or tails in a coin flip or selecting ‘rock, scissor or paper’. The decks need to be randomized and can shuffled with a card shuffling algorithm, popular methods include the overhand and riffle shuffle [4]. Often a game is played between two human players but an AI can be used as an opponent which is useful for testing decks. A battle with human player can be done by connecting to the lobby. An AI must be created and programmed to make the correct choices, this will reflect in its difficulty. The AI shouldn’t be too predictable for example if the AI has a powerful one of a kind card that can destroy all creatures on the battlefield using it whenever a single creature is summoned is easy for the player to work around.
<br><br>
There are many phases in the game such as standby phase, draw phase, main phase, battle phase and end of turn phase. Card effects can be activated in any one of these phases, the challenge will be to make sure that the effects do exactly what is expected and nothing more. When there are bugs in games players will exploit them and try to profit as much as possible. The battlefield needs to be simple enough so new players won't get overwhelmed and can play without difficulty but have enough complexity to allow both beginners and experienced players to make informed decisions. Knowing what the opponent has used, how many cards are in their hand and the number of cards left in the deck allows players to utilize strategy to bait their opponent and gain the advantage. A mouse over feature could be useful here, when the mouse is on a certain element the area could expand and show more detail.
<br><br>
The skills I would need to create my project is knowledge in a programming language that is suitable for creating games such as C++. C++ gives the developer more control, offers more support with its large community as well as multiple frameworks [5]. C++ is faster than most languages, games often push hardware to its limits so the code must to be as fast as possible. The software I would consider using would be the Unreal Engine or Unity. Hearthstone a popular digital CCG was built using Unity as it allowed the developer to create the game for multiple devices such as tablet and mobile phones [6].
<br><br>
There isn't many digital CCGs on pc or mobile devices, the game could become popular if it is simple enough to learn. This development is mainly for my entertainment, a way to express my creativity and constantly give me motivation to improve my skills.
